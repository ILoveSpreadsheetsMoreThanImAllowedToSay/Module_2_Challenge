1. Project's Title
Basic Stock Performance Analysis

2. Project Description
This VBA script provides a basic analysis of stock performance for a given list of stock tickers and their opening and closing values, every day, over the course of a year.  
It extracts the unique ticker symbols provided, performs a n annual performance in terms of start and end of year values both in raw and percentage change, and provides the total stock volume for the ticker.  
It provides a secondary table identifying the best and worst performing tickers and the one with the most volume as well. 
It scales to as many annual lists as provided and does not have a limit to the number of tickers to review.
Future iterations will accommodate ticker lists that are not pre-sorted into an ordered list of tickers and ordered by date.  Additionally it will incorporate simply projections, provide a waterfall chart, and categorize tickers based on their volatility.
VBA was used as .CSV is one of the most common output types for large quantities of data.  Additionally the analysis is rudimentary at this time, and a simple script such as this is all that is needed for the analysis requested.

3. How to Install and Run the Project
This project requires an import of the VBA script into your Excel sheet, or a copy/paste of the VBA script from the provided .TXT file.
Once data is incorporated adequately and the script installed, run the macro and wait for the script to complete computing.

4. How to Use the Project
The data format expected is:
Stock tickers and their daily opening and closing values.  These are to be in alphabetical order followed by chronological sorting.  Additionally stock volume is necessary.
This project assumes an input of 7 columns’ of data, and requires their organization as follows:
[Ticker] [Date] [Opening Value] [Daily High (Optional)] [Daily Low (Optional)] [Closing Value] [Volume]
As many years’ data is allowed, so long as each year is stored in a separate tab in the housing excel file.
See attached screenshots for examples of the columns and outputs for a sample dataset of 2018, 2019, and 2020.
